Returning first 10 rows from a table:

            SELECT *
            FROM recent_grads
            LIMIT 10;
           
Filtering return results:

            SELECT Major, Major_category, Median, ShareWomen 
            FROM recent_grads 
            WHERE ShareWomen > 0.5 AND Median > 50000;
            
Filtering results using the OR clause:

            SELECT Major, Median, Unemployed
            FROM recent_grads 
            WHERE Median >= 10000 OR Unemployed <= 1000 
            LIMIT 20;
            
Grouping using AND and OR with parentheses:

            SELECT Major, Major_category, ShareWomen, Unemployment_rate
            FROM recent_grads
            WHERE (Major_category = 'Engineering') AND (ShareWomen > 0.5 OR Unemployment_rate < 0.051);

Sorting results:

            SELECT Major, ShareWomen, Unemployment_rate 
            FROM recent_grads
            WHERE ShareWomen > 0.3 AND Unemployment_rate < 0.1
            ORDER BY ShareWomen DESC;
